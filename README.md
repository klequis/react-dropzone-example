# React Dropzone Example

## What

An example of using React Dropzone for CSV files.

## Why

There is a limitation due to different browsers and operating systems. See this issue: [MIME type mismatch between platforms](https://github.com/react-dropzone/react-dropzone/issues/276)

If you read through the above issue you will see there is a potentially better solution in the works. I took a different approach which is less desirable but meets my needs: display accepted and rejected files in UI based on file extention.
